Using this Password Analyzer, you'll be able to test the strength of any password. The application is created with a purely educational purpose using JavaScript, in order to help you understand how to create a strong password. You'll be provided with real-time feedback about bad practices, and about how to improve the strength of the password.Â  However, there is no official weighting system to assess the strength of any given password, so I'm using multiple factors and custom formulas in my algorithm. Check out my blog page (https://viruszzwarning.medium.com) for more details.
